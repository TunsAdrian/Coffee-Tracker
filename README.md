Coffee Tracker aplication created for Google Android Fundamentals Course. The purpose of this application is to help in tracking how many coffees someone drinks in a day, while also providing a vizualization of how productive that person is after drinking the coffees. Many persons tend to drink several coffees, believing that in this way they will get the energy required to go through the day, not realizing that more than often the productiviy levels do not increase, yet the caffeine intake does.

For this application, sign-in with a Google account is required after opening the application. There are 3 coffee sizes that can have their default values set to any value between 0 and 200 mg. After registering a coffee, at a certain amount of time (5 seconds now, for testing purposes; a more appropiate value would be 1 hour) a push notification will be received, to remember to rate the productivity levels felt after drinking said coffee. After rating the productivity leves on a scale from 1 to 5, the statistics will be updated. They can be accesed from the drawer menu. And finally, in order to delete an entry from the coffee list, a swipe from left to right is needed.
